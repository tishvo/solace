With additional time, I would have liked to address the following - 
- Loading treatment 
- Expand on UI in the page header
- Add the ability for a user to search advocates via more than one field (i.e., user should be able to type in first AND last name and have results return)
- For very large data sets (e.g., hundreds of thousands of advocates), I would like to move the search logic into the server and add pagination logic. This would increase performance by limiting the amount of data sent to the client. We can also then add a cache layer on the server to further optimize performance.
